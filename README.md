# Memories in a network with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity are encoded in the spiking irregularity

This is the code used for all simulations and figures in the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.22.453370v1)

You need:  

Python 3 (numpy, matplotlib, h5py, scipy)  

[NEST](https://www.nest-simulator.org/): The simulations were performed on NEST 2.20.0, but with a small alteration on the rule for the triplet-based STDP model. Specifically, a minimum bound for the weights was introduced, as compared to the standard distribution. To install this version of NEST:  

- Download the source code:  
git clone https://github.com/juliavg/nest-simulator.git  
cd nest-simulator/  
git checkout wmin_triplet  

- Compile the downloaded source code by following "Advanced installation" instructions on:  
https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0/installation/index.html  

---

Before running the code:  

Open support/parameters.py and include the path to where you would like to save simulation data and the figures

---

Run the code for the desired figure using the shell scripts. 

Dependencies: figure4.sh and supp_figure4.sh have to be executed after figure3.sh, since they both read data from data_assembly.hdf5, which is generated by figure3.sh
